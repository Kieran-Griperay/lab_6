# lab_6 NAME DUPLICATOR
*This program takes in your first name, then asks for how many times you want to print it out, then prints it out that many times*
## Motivation
*We wanted to create a project that would change the world by allowing someone to duplicate their name as many times as they want. Gone are the days of rewriting your name 100 times, you simply put in the 2 inputs and there you are.*
## build status
*fully completed*
## Code Style 
*python*
## Features
*The project is not limited to just names, any string that you want duplicated can be duplicated. 
## How to use
*We wanted the program to be easy to use, simply follow the prompts, and input your name followed by a number.*
## Contribute
*build on our project! Add another field for a capitalization field or any other font you want the output to be*
